Algebra Academy is an interactive online platform designed to help students master algebraic concepts through visualizations, manipulatives, and personalized learning experiences.
It includes various helpful features such as interactive learning, personalized modules, and a progress tracker with reporting to see performance over time.

This is a demo landing page for CIS 3500 (Software Design), a class at UPenn. Link to view page is provided: https://skanderi7.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-domain-name/

In this new and improved repository of Hugo-Mock-Landing-Page, a workflow is created to automate the deployment of the website whenever code is pushed to the main branch of the repository (hence the title hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed). Each time a change is committed, the Hugo environment is initialized, and the compiled website files are published to GitHub pages.
